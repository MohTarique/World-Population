# World-Population
World Population Prospects is the twenty-eighth edition of official United Nations population estimates and projections that have been prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. It presents population estimates from 2010 to 2040 and consist of populations across different continents and countries with age category and genderwise division.

In this project we use this data after cleaning and modelling for our visualizations
